First you have to download the .exe file. 

When you open the file, you have to click on *Start Autoclicker* to enable the toggle-key that
you can start the actual autoclicking with. 

With *Stop Autoclicker* you can disable the toggle-key.

Below the top caption there is a red indicator line. When it's red, the toggle-key is disabled, 
and when it's green the toggle-key is enabled. 


You can set the clicking rate with a slide. It shows the time between two clicks in seconds. 
You don't have to disable the toggle-key to set it up (so you're able to
change it even while the indicator is
green).

At the bottom there is a caption showing your current toggle-key which is "รณ" at default settings.
You can change that by clicking on the button below the caption and press any key on your keyboard
(mouse buttons don't work yet). With the green button, you can save your changes.
